DESCRIPTION
All preprocessors are started with "==PREPROCESSOR==" and ended with "==/PREPROCESSOR==":

// ==PREPROCESSOR==
// ...
// ==/PREPROCESSOR==

And be aware that all preprocessors (directives) are case sensitive.

DIRECTIVES
Directives should be started with "@", and placed into a single comment.

// @directive "value-here"

IMPORT
@import "path"
Load external script from "path". These files should be UTF8 only (with or without BOM).
You can place %fb2k_path%, %fb2k_component_path% and %fb2k_profile_path% in to "path", they
will be expanded while parsing.

FEATURE
@feature "dragdrop"
Enable drag drop callbacks. See https://github.com/marc2k3/foo_jscript_panel/wiki/Drag-and-Drop

NAME
@name "name"

VERSION
@version "version"

AUTHOR
@author "author"

As of v2.2.0, you can use double quotes in the name/author without escaping them.

Example:
// ==PREPROCESSOR==
// @name "my sooper dooper script"
// @author "marc"
// @version "0.1"
// @feature "dragdrop"
// @import "%fb2k_component_path%docs\flags.txt"
// @import "%fb2k_component_path%docs\helpers.txt"
// ==/PREPROCESSOR==
