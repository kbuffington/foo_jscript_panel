## Samples

### Requirements

Although the component has been updated to run on any version of `Windows` supported by [foobar2000](https://foobar2000.org) itself, some scripts have their own.

### Samples\Basic

All these should work fine on any system.

### Samples\Complete

Most scripts in this folder require the installation of [FontAwesome](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome/blob/fa-4/fonts/fontawesome-webfont.ttf?raw=true)

All these scripts should work on any system with `IE8` or later installed.

There are three exceptions:

`Listenbrainz` requires any version of `Windows` with `IE9` or later installed. Note that since this script was created, it has been superceded by a [dedicated component](../foo_listenbrainz2.md).

`Thumbs` can display existing images on any system but requires any version of `Windows` with at least `IE9` to download new ones. Downloading does not work on `Windows XP`/`WINE`.

`Last.fm Lover` doesn't work on `Windows XP`/`WINE`. Requires any version of `Windows` with `IE9` or later.

### Samples\JSPlaylist, Samples\JS-Smooth

These scripts should work fine on any system. The following fonts are required:

[Guifx v2 Transports.ttf](http://blog.guifx.com/2009/04/02/guifx-v2-transport-font/), `wingdings2.ttf`, `wingdings3.ttf`

If you have `Microsoft Office` installed, you should have the `wingdings` fonts. If not, you'll have to search for them.

### Usage

From the [Configuration Window](Configuration-Window.md) simply use the `Samples` menu to quickly select the one you want.
